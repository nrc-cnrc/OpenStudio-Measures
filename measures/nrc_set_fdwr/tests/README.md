# Summary Of Test Cases for 'SET FDWR' Measure
 
The following describe the parameter tests that are conducted on the measure. Note some of the 
tests are designed to return a fail and some a success. The report below contains all the tests that 
have the correct response. For example the argument range limit tests are expected to fail.
