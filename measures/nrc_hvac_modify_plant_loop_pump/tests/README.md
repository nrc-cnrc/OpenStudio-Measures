# Summary Of Test Cases for 'MODIFY HVAC PLANT LOOP PUMP PARAMETERS' Measure
 
The following describe the parameter tests that are conducted on the measure. Note some of the 
tests are designed to return a fail and some a success. The report below contains all the tests that 
have the correct response. For example the argument range limit tests are expected to fail.
